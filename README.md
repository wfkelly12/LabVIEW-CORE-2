# LabVIEW-CORE-2
The LabVIEW Core 2 course is an extension of the LabVIEW Core 1 course and teaches you to use common design patterns to successfully implement and distribute LabVIEW applications for research, engineering, and testing environments. Topics covered include programmatic control of your user interface, implementation of parallel loops, creating an event-driven applications, managing configuration settings in configuration files, and developing an error handling strategy for an application. This course directly links LabVIEW functionality to your application needs, and provides a jump-start for application development.
